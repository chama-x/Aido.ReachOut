# Requirements Analysis for Google Maps Business Scraper (Sri Lanka)

## Input Parameters
- **Area Specification**: The scraper should accept location input in multiple formats:
  - City/town name (e.g., "Colombo", "Kandy", "Galle")
  - Specific address in Sri Lanka
  - Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude)
  - District name (e.g., "Colombo District", "Gampaha District")
  
- **Radius Parameter**: 
  - Accept radius in kilometers
  - Default radius should be reasonable for Sri Lankan urban density (e.g., 5km)
  - Maximum radius should be limited to prevent excessive requests
  - Support for different search densities in urban vs. rural areas

## Output Requirements
- **Business Data Format**:
  - Business name (in English and local languages where available)
  - Phone number(s) with proper Sri Lankan formatting (+94 format)
  - Address
  - Business category/type
  - Rating (if available)
  - Operating hours (if available)
  
- **Export Formats**:
  - CSV for easy spreadsheet import
  - JSON for programmatic use
  - Optional: Excel format

## Sri Lanka Specific Considerations
- **Phone Number Formats**:
  - Sri Lankan mobile numbers: +94 7X XXX XXXX
  - Sri Lankan landline numbers: +94 X XXX XXXX (varies by region)
  - Handle local formats (0XX-XXXXXXX) and convert to international format
  
- **Addressing System**:
  - Support for Sri Lankan addressing conventions
  - Handle both English and Sinhala/Tamil address formats
  - District and province-based location filtering
  
- **Language Support**:
  - Handle multilingual business names (Sinhala, Tamil, English)
  - Proper encoding for Sinhala and Tamil characters
  
- **Geographic Coverage**:
  - Special handling for densely populated areas (Colombo, Kandy, etc.)
  - Adjustments for rural areas with sparse business listings
  - Coverage for all 9 provinces and 25 districts

## Error Handling & Robustness
- **Network Resilience**:
  - Handle intermittent connectivity issues common in some Sri Lankan regions
  - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Resume capability for interrupted scraping sessions
  
- **Data Validation**:
  - Verify phone number formats against Sri Lankan standards
  - Validate addresses against known administrative divisions
  - Flag potentially incorrect or incomplete data
  
- **Anti-Blocking Measures**:
  - Implement request rate limiting appropriate for Sri Lankan IP addresses
  - Rotate user agents and implement other anti-detection measures
  - Use proxy rotation if necessary (with Sri Lankan proxies if available)

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **Terms of Service Compliance**:
  - Review Google Maps Terms of Service regarding automated data collection
  - Implement respectful scraping practices (rate limiting, caching)
  
- **Data Privacy**:
  - Handle business data in compliance with Sri Lankan data protection regulations
  - No collection of personal data beyond publicly available business information
  
- **Usage Limitations**:
  - Clear documentation on acceptable use cases
  - Warnings against mass harvesting or spam activities
  - Recommendation to respect business owners' communication preferences

## Performance Requirements
- **Efficiency**:
  - Optimize for potentially slower internet connections in some regions
  - Minimize bandwidth usage through selective data retrieval
  - Implement caching to reduce redundant requests
  
- **Scalability**:
  - Support for both small area searches and larger district-wide searches
  - Pagination handling for areas with many businesses
  - Memory-efficient processing for large result sets

## Implementation Priorities
1. Accuracy of business name and phone number extraction
2. Robustness against Google Maps UI/API changes
3. Error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Sri Lanka-specific optimizations
5. Performance and efficiency
