# Google Maps Business Scraper Architecture Design

This document outlines the architecture for a robust, efficient, and error-resistant Google Maps business scraper tailored for Sri Lanka.

## 1. Overall Architecture

The scraper will follow a modular, layered architecture with the following components:

### Hybrid Approach Implementation

Based on SOTA research, we'll implement a hybrid approach that combines:

1. **Primary Method**: Specialized Google Maps Scraper API integration
2. **Fallback Method**: Custom browser automation with Playwright
3. **Validation Method**: Direct Google Maps Platform API calls (where applicable)

This provides redundancy, flexibility, and optimal performance.

- Location proximity analysis

### 2.5 Storage Layer

#### Export Module

## 3. Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - User provides location and radius
   - Input is validated and normalized
   - Location is geocoded if necessary

2. **Job Planning**:
   - Area is subdivided if radius is too large
   - Search strategy is determined based on area characteristics
   - Tasks are created and queued

3. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Primary method (API) is attempted first
   - If unsuccessful, fallback to browser automation
   - Results are cached to minimize redundant requests

4. **Data Processing**:
   - Raw data is parsed and structured
   - Business information is validated and normalized
   - Duplicates are identified and merged

5. **Result Delivery**:
   - Data is exported in requested format
   - Summary statistics are generated
   - Logs and diagnostics are compiled

## 4. Error Handling and Resilience

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- Categorized error types (network, parsing, validation)
- Graceful degradation on partial failures
- Detailed error logging with context

### Retry Mechanisms
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for persistent issues
- Alternative method switching on failure

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time performance metrics
- Anomaly detection for blocking or rate limiting
- Threshold-based alerts for error rates

## 5. Sri Lanka-Specific Optimizations

### Location Handling
- Support for Sri Lankan administrative divisions (provinces, districts)
- Special handling for densely populated areas (Colombo, Kandy)
- Rural area optimizations with wider search radii

### Language Support
- Proper handling of Sinhala and Tamil character encoding
- Transliteration capabilities between scripts
- Language detection for mixed-language content

- Conversion between local and international formats

## 6. Performance Considerations
